name: Release Please

# This workflow uses release-please to automatically create semantic version tags
# and GitHub releases based on conventional commit messages.
#
# How it works:
# 1. On push to main, release-please analyzes commit messages
# 2. It creates a Release PR with version bump and changelog
# 3. When the Release PR is merged, it automatically creates:
#    - A semantic version tag (e.g., v1.2.3)
#    - A GitHub release with changelog
#
# Commit message format (Conventional Commits):
# - feat: New feature (minor version bump)
# - fix: Bug fix (patch version bump)
# - feat!: Breaking change (major version bump)
# - docs, perf, refactor, test, build, ci, chore: No version bump by default
#
# The created tags will automatically trigger the docker-publish workflow.
